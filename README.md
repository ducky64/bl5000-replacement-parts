Replacement lever (trigger) part. Has a cutout over the switch to allow operating mode to be switched without uninstalling the lever.

External components required:

- A 3mm (diameter) x 2mm (length) cylidrical magnet, to be press-fitted into the slot near the end of the lever. This is the "actuator", the screwdriver has a magnetic field sensor as the trigger.
- A spring, between 4mm and 6mm in diameter, inserted near the pivot point. This provides return force. If you already have a lever, you can take the spring from that.
- A ~20mm M3 screw, used for the pivot. If you already have a lever, you can take the screw from that.

## AndersonConnectorPlateHalf
![Image](../master/docs/anderson-half-plate.png?raw=true)

Replacement rear connector "plate" designed to accept an Anderson Powerpole 15/30/45A housings. Will need internal rewiring and soldering, but these screwdrivers will work off 12V. Print two of these, sandwich a Powerpole connector between them, and insert them where the metal circular connector used to be. May require a bit of trial-and-error to properly tolerance the part so that it is neither too loose or too large.
